        This project was created to collect data to improve accuracy of sensors on Moto 360 smartwatch. The application was distributed among large group of testers. The main focus was to improve heart rate sensor accuracy during various types of workouts. To compare data with other devices a tester was required to wear multiple heart rate measuring devices connected to the same application running on Android phone.
